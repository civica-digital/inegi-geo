# INEGI (Geospatial database)
> Imports [INEGI geospatial database][inegi] into a readable CSV

Every application interacting with the INGEI's geospatial data, uses a
standalone copy of the database, or implements its own _snowflake_ solution,
causing **inconsistencies**, missing the benefits of having a centralized
source of truth.

Unluckily we couldn't figure out how to prevent this :sweat:.

However, `inegi-geo` removes the hassle of importing the INEGI's geospatial
data into a readable CSV that you can edit to select the combinations you
want.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'inegi-geo'
```

And then execute:
```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself:
```
$ gem install inegi-geo
```

## Usage

Once the gem is installed, run the following command to **download** the dataset
and **transform** it into a CSV.

```bash
rake inegi:geo:download inegi:geo:transform

# DOWNLOADED: states.zip (%100)
# DOWNLOADED: municipalities.zip (%100)
# DOWNLOADED: localities.zip (%100)
# UNZIP: localities.zip -> localities.dbf
# UNZIP: municipalities.zip -> municipalities.dbf
# UNZIP: states.zip -> states.dbf
# CONVERTED: localities.dbf -> localities.csv
# CONVERTED: municipalities.dbf -> municipalities.csv
# CONVERTED: states.dbf -> states.csv
```

Delete the `.zip` and `.dbf` or put them on your `.gitignore` if you want
to save them locally.

```bash
rm -f datasets/*[^.csv]
```

After editing the CSV to select the columns that you want, you can use
[activerecord-import][activerecord-import] to insert the data in the CSVs into
your database.

```bash
# head -n 5 states.csv

"code","name"
"01","Aguascalientes"
"02","Baja California"
"03","Baja California Sur"
"04","Campeche"
```

```bash
# head -n 5 municipalities.csv

"state_code","code","name"
"01","001","Aguascalientes"
"01","002","Asientos"
"01","003","Calvillo"
"01","004","CosÃ­o"
```

```bash
# head -n 5 localities.csv

"state_code","municipality_code","code","name"
"01","001","0001","Aguascalientes"
"01","001","0094","Granja Adelita"
"01","001","0096","Agua Azul"
"01","001","0100","Rancho Alegre"
```

The size of the CSVs:

```txt
Size Name
---- ----
 10M localities.csv
 68k municipalities.csv
 612 states.csv
```


_:warning: Review and understand the code before copying and pasting it._

In this example, I chose to store `State`, `Municipality`, and `Locality`.

```bash
rails generate model state code:string \
                           name:string

rails generate model municipality code:string \
                                  name:string \
                                  state_code:string \
                                  state:references

rails generate model locality code:string \
                              name:string \
                              state_code:string \
                              state:references \
                              municipality_code:string \
                              municipality:references
```

```ruby
require 'activerecord-import/base'
require 'activerecord-import/active_record/adapters/postgresql_adapter'

def import_from_csv(dataset)
  file = Rails.root.join('datasets', "#{dataset}.csv")
  klass = dataset.classify.constantize

  return if klass.count > 0

  print "\rImporting #{dataset.pluralize}..."

  klass.transaction do
    rows = CSV.read(file)
    headers = rows.delete_at(0)
    klass.import(headers, rows, validate: false)
  end

  puts "\rImported #{dataset.pluralize}: #{klass.count}"
end

def update_references
  return unless Municipality.where(state_id: nil).exists? ||
                Locality.where(municipality_id: nil).exists?

  print "\rUpdating references..."

  states = <<~SQL
    UPDATE municipalities
    SET state_id = states.id
    FROM states
    WHERE municipalities.state_code = states.code;

    UPDATE localities
    SET state_id = states.id
    FROM states
    WHERE localities.state_code = states.code;
  SQL

  municipalities = <<~SQL
    UPDATE localities
    SET municipality_id = municipalities.id
    FROM municipalities
    WHERE localities.state_code = municipalities.state_code
      AND localities.municipality_code = municipalities.code;
  SQL

  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(states)
  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(municipalities)

  puts "\rUpdating references: DONE"
end

import_from_csv 'states'
import_from_csv 'municipalities'
import_from_csv 'localities'
update_references
```

The code above imports the data from the CSV to the models, and update
the references. The time to run this (in my computer) is below **1 second**.
